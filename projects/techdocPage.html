            </ul> In the favorites menu, it shows all your Favorited items.
            <br>In the All menu, it shows all items.
            <br>The weapons menu holds swords, staffs, bows and arrows.

            A hollow white triangle is displayed to the right of any weapons (excluding staves) or apparel (excluding
            jewelry) that is considered to be the best item of its type in the player's inventory. Weapon types are
            classified as one-handed (includes daggers), two-handed, bows, and arrows. Apparel types are classified as
            head, body, hands, feet, and shield. Of special note, head armor is additionally classified into light and
            heavy when being considered as a suggested upgrade.

        <section class="main-section" id="Magic">
            <header>Magic</header>
            <p>The Magic tab includes the available Spells to the player. There is a category for each school, over the
                submenus "all" and "favorites." This section also shows all learned Dragon Shouts. The magic tab also is
                where the player unlocks shouts and keeps track of dragon souls taken. Lastly, this tab is where can
                find their active effects, including any diseases they might have.</p>
            <p><code>to add favorite spells<br>Press "f" key</code></p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Favorites">
            <header>Favorites</header>
            <p>Favorited items or spells will be marked with an asterisk and Equipped items will be marked with an
                arrow. After an item or spell is Favorited, it can be quickly accessed from a list of all the Favorites
                using <code>the "Q" button on PC or holding up or down</code> on the Xbox and the PS3 D-pad.</p>

            <p>Favorited items can also be bound to the number keys. This can be done by opening the Favorites menu and
                <code>pressing a number key</code>. The selected favorite can then be quickly equipped by pressing the
                number key that the item/spell was bound to.

                For PS3 and Xbox's users, <code>holding left or right on the D-pad</code> in Favorite list will at "1"
                and "2" (respectively) next to the items' names. <code>Pressing left or right</code> will make the
                Dragonborn use the marked items in real-time. Spells and weapons also can be marked this way, but it may
                take times to fully understand which spells/equipment will go to which hands.

                For example: 1. Fast Healing and 2. Firebolt.
            </p>

            <p>Pressing left D-pad once will add Fast Healing to the left hand. Pressing it once more will add another
                Fast Healing to the right hand. Same with Firebolt but with the right D-pad.

                To add both spells to each hand (left Fast Healing and right Firebolt). Press right, right, left.

                One-handed weapons will always be equipped to the right hand unless the Dragonborn has more than one of
                the same weapons for dual-wielding. This also true for default left hand items such as shields and
                torch.

                Marking a combination of Health, Magicka, or Stamina Potions will make it easier to use them whenever
                needed without going into the Favorite list.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Skills">
            <header>Skills</header>
            <p>In the Skills menu, the player "looks to the stars." The player then scrolls across and can choose
                between all the skills (magic colleges, classes e.t.c). When the player gains skill points, they may
                choose one of the many Perks if they have level or more points than the required skill points.</p>

            <p>As the player chooses perks, a Constellation appears.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Map">
            <header>Map</header>
            <p>The Map in Skyrim zooms out from your current position and is used to access the journal. The triggers
                zoom in and out when the map is accessed and the "A" (Xbox 360) or "X"(The old model) or "O" (The slim
                model) buttons are used to place waypoints. The start button accesses the journal and "X" (Xbox 360) or
                "square" (PS3) enters the local map. While on PC, the "M" key pulls up the map, with "W," "S," "D," and
                "A," allowing the player to move around. The mouse-wheel zooms in and out of the map.</p>
